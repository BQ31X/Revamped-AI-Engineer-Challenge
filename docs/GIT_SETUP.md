# 🔧 Git Setup Guide

Ready to level up your Git game? This guide is your ticket to becoming a Git ninja! We'll walk you through everything from basic setup to advanced workflows, making sure you're ready to rock your development journey. Just replace the placeholders (like `<YOUR-USERNAME>`) with your actual info, and you're good to go! 🚀

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before we dive in, let's make sure you've got the essentials:

1. 🌐 A GitHub account (your passport to the coding universe)
2. 🔧 Git installed on your local machine (the command-line magic wand)
3. 💻 A code editor (like Cursor, VS Code, etc. - your digital workshop)
4. ⌨️ Terminal access (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt/PowerShell (Windows) - your command center
5. 🔑 A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) - your secret handshake with GitHub

<details>
  <summary>✅ Let's Make Sure Everything's Working!</summary>

  ```bash
  # Check if Git is ready to rock
  git --version

  # Test your GitHub connection (no more "who are you?" errors!)
  git ls-remote https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<REPO-NAME>.git
  ```
</details>

## ⚙️ Initial Setup

### 1. Configure Git Identity

Time to tell Git who you are! This is like setting up your developer ID card:

```bash
# Set your name and email (Git needs to know who's making those awesome commits!)
git config --global user.name "<YOUR-NAME>"
git config --global user.email "<YOUR-EMAIL>"

# Double-check your settings (always good to verify!)
git config --list
```

<details>
  <summary>✅ Let's Make Sure Git Knows Who You Are!</summary>

  ```bash
  # Check if Git recognizes you
  git config user.name
  git config user.email

  # Should show your name and email - if not, Git might be confused! 🤔
  ```
</details>

### 2. Set Up GitHub Authentication

<details>
  <summary>🔐 Setting Up Your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)</summary>

  > 📸 **Need visual guidance?** Check out our [Detailed PAT Setup Guide](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/Interactive-Dev-Environment-for-LLM-Development#setting-up-your-github-personal-access-token) with step-by-step screenshots!

  1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT):
     - Head to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
     - Click "Generate new token" (your golden ticket)
     - Set permissions (at minimum: "Contents - Read and write")
     - Copy and store your token somewhere safe (like a password manager)

  2. Configure credential storage (so you don't have to type your token every time):

  ```bash
  # For macOS (stores in Keychain - your digital vault)
  git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

  # For Windows (stores in Credential Manager - your Windows safe)
  git config --global credential.helper wincred

  # For Linux (stores in memory - your temporary sticky note)
  git config --global credential.helper cache
  ```

  3. Verify your setup:
  ```bash
  # Test your authentication (time to show GitHub who's boss!)
  git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<YOUR-REPO-NAME>.git
  # You should be prompted for your username and PAT
  ```
</details>

## 🚀 Repository Setup

<details>
  <summary>🔄 Forking and Cloning</summary>

  ### 1. Fork the Repository

  1. Navigate to the original repository
  2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner (it's like making your own copy of the recipe!)
     ![Fork Button](https://i.imgur.com/bhjySNh.png)
  3. Keep the repository name as is or change it if you prefer
  4. Click "Create fork" (and just like that, you've got your own copy! 🎉)

  ### 2. Clone Your Fork

  ```bash
  # Navigate to where you want your project to live
  cd PATH_TO_DESIRED_PARENT_DIRECTORY

  # Clone your fork (this is like downloading your copy to your computer)
  git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<REPO-NAME>.git

  # Move into your new project directory
  cd <REPO-NAME>

  # Add the original repository as "upstream" (so you can keep up with the cool updates!)
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/<ORIGINAL-REPO-OWNER>/<REPO-NAME>.git

  # Check your remote connections
  git remote -v
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>✅ Let's Make Sure Everything's Connected!</summary>

    ```bash
    # Check your remote setup
    git remote -v
    # Should show both 'origin' (your fork) and 'upstream' (original repo)

    # Test your connections
    git fetch origin
    git fetch upstream
    # If these work, you're all set! 🎯
    ```
  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>📁 Configuring .gitignore</summary>

  Create a `.gitignore` file to keep unnecessary files out of your repository (like a bouncer at a club, it decides what gets in and what stays out!):

  ```bash
  # Create .gitignore
  touch .gitignore
  ```

  Add common patterns:

  ```gitignore
  # Dependencies (the heavy stuff)
  node_modules/
  venv/
  __pycache__/

  # Environment (your secret sauce)
  .env
  .env.local

  # IDE (your workspace settings)
  .vscode/
  .idea/
  *.swp

  # OS (those pesky system files)
  .DS_Store
  Thumbs.db
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>✅ Let's Make Sure Your .gitignore is Working!</summary>

    ```bash
    # Check if .gitignore is doing its job
    git status
    # Should not show any ignored files - if it does, your bouncer might be sleeping! 😴
    ```
  </details>
</details>

## 🔄 Development Workflow

<details>
  <summary>🌿 Branch Management</summary>

  ### 1. Creating and Switching Branches

  ```bash
  # Create and switch to a new branch (like creating a new timeline!)
  git checkout -b <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>

  # Switch between branches (time travel, Git style!)
  git checkout <BRANCH-NAME>

  # List all branches (see all your parallel universes)
  git branch -a
  ```

  ### 2. Making Changes

  ```bash
  # Check status (what's changed in your universe?)
  git status

  # Stage changes (get your changes ready for the spotlight)
  git add <FILE-NAME>
  # or stage all changes (the "select all" of Git)
  git add .

  # Commit changes (seal the deal with a message)
  git commit -m "Description of changes"

  # Push to your fork (send your changes to the cloud)
  git push origin <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>
  ```

  ### 3. Keeping Your Fork Updated

  ```bash
  # Fetch upstream changes (see what's new in the original)
  git fetch upstream

  # Merge upstream changes (bring in the cool new stuff)
  git merge upstream/main

  # Push updates to your fork (share the love)
  git push origin main
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>✅ Let's Check Your Branch Status!</summary>

    ```bash
    # Check branch status (see all your parallel universes)
    git branch -v
    # Should show all branches and their status

    # Verify remote tracking (make sure you're not lost in space)
    git branch -vv
    # Should show tracking information
    ```
  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>📝 Commit Message Conventions</summary>

  ### Conventional Commits

  Use this format for commit messages (like writing a good story):
  ```
  <type>(<scope>): <description>

  [optional body]

  [optional footer]
  ```

  Common types:
  1. `feat`: New feature (the cool new stuff)
  2. `fix`: Bug fix (the superhero saves the day)
  3. `docs`: Documentation changes (making things clearer)
  4. `style`: Code style changes (making it pretty)
  5. `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features (spring cleaning)
  6. `test`: Adding or modifying tests (making sure everything works)
  7. `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools (housekeeping)

  Examples:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support"
  git commit -m "fix(api): resolve timeout issues in user endpoint"
  git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
  ```

  <details>
    <summary>✅ Let's Check Your Commit Message Style!</summary>

    ```bash
    # Check your last commit message
    git log -1
    # Should follow the conventional format - if not, time for a rewrite! ✍️
    ```
  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>🔄 Pull Request Workflow</summary>

  ### 1. Creating a Pull Request

  1. Push your changes to your fork (get your code ready for the spotlight)
  2. Go to your fork on GitHub
  3. Click "Compare & pull request" (time to show off your work!)
  4. Fill in the PR template (tell everyone what you've been up to)
  5. Request reviews from team members (get some expert eyes on your work)

  ### 2. PR Best Practices

  - Write clear, descriptive titles (make it pop!)
  - Link related issues (connect the dots)
  - Include screenshots for UI changes (show, don't just tell)
  - Keep PRs focused and small (bite-sized is better)
  - Respond to review comments promptly (keep the conversation flowing)

  <details>
    <summary>✅ Let's Make Sure Your PR is Ready to Rock!</summary>

    ```bash
    # Check your branch status
    git status
    # Should be clean - no uncommitted changes

    # Verify your commits
    git log --oneline
    # Should show clear, conventional commit messages

    # Check if you're up to date
    git fetch upstream
    git status
    # Should be up to date with upstream
    ```
  </details>
</details>
