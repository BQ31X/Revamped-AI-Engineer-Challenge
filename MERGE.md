   - `/api/chat-with-pdf` - RAG-based chat with PDFs
   - `/api/pdfs` - List all uploaded PDFs
   - `/api/pdf/{pdf_id}` - Delete specific PDFs
   - Enhanced error handling and validation

### Technical Implementation:

- **Backend**: FastAPI with aimakerspace library integration
- **Vector Database**: In-memory storage with cosine similarity search
- **Text Processing**: Character-based text splitting with overlap
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small model
- **Chat Model**: OpenAI gpt-4o-mini with streaming responses
- **File Handling**: Temporary file processing with automatic cleanup

git push origin --delete feature/pdf-rag-system
```

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. OpenAI API key
2. PDF file for testing
3. Both backend and frontend running

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Navigate to API directory
cd api

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the API server
python app.py
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Manual Test Cases

1. **PDF Upload Test**
   - Enter OpenAI API key
   - Upload a PDF file
   - Verify success message and chunk count
   - Check PDF appears in the list

2. **RAG Chat Test**
   - Select "Chat with PDF" mode
   - Choose an uploaded PDF
   - Ask questions about the PDF content
   - Verify relevant, contextual responses

3. **Regular Chat Test**
   - Switch to "Regular Chat" mode
   - Ask general questions
   - Verify normal chat functionality

4. **PDF Management Test**
   - Upload multiple PDFs
   - Switch between PDFs
   - Delete PDFs
   - Verify proper cleanup

## Deployment Considerations

### Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are set in production:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for server-side operations if needed)

### Production Recommendations
1. **Replace in-memory storage** with persistent vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Chroma)
2. **Add file size limits** for PDF uploads
3. **Implement user authentication** for PDF access control
4. **Add rate limiting** for API endpoints
5. **Use cloud storage** for PDF file persistence
6. **Add logging** and monitoring
7. **Implement caching** for embeddings

### Security Notes
- API keys are sent with each request (frontend-managed)
- PDFs are temporarily stored and processed server-side
- No persistent storage of sensitive data in current implementation
- Consider implementing server-side API key management for production

## Files Modified

### Backend (`/api/`)
- `app.py` - Enhanced with PDF upload and RAG endpoints
- `requirements.txt` - Added PDF processing dependencies

### Frontend (`/frontend/`)
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Complete UI overhaul with PDF management

### Root
- `MERGE.md` - This merge instruction file

## Dependencies Added
- `PyPDF2==3.0.1` - PDF text extraction
- `python-dotenv==1.0.0` - Environment variable management  
- `numpy>=1.26.0` - Vector operations (Python 3.13 compatible)

## Breaking Changes
None - All changes are additive and backward compatible.
